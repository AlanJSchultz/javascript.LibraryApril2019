/*
repl.it 02.01-Loops with an Array

Using the array [1, 10, 8, 5, 7, 11], write a for loop that console.logs 'your number is even' if the number is even and 'your number is odd' if your number is odd.

Once you've solved this with a for loop, solve this with a for-of loop.

Finally, solve this challenge with a for-in loop.
