/*
repl.it - 02.02-Object keys and Object value

Use the function 'objectChecker' to accept the object {name: 'Batman', age: 42, isVillain: false}.  Your function should return an array that has three elements inside: 

a)  an array of all the keys in the object,

b)  an array of all the values in the object, 

c)  the number of key-value pairs in the object.  Make sure the array has items a, b, and c in order.

Be sure to console.log what your function returns so you can see it!
