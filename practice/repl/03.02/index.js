/*
Let's use the Rick and Morty API to grab character names and display them to the screen.
We want to focus on fetching and displaying content to the screen, so I'll share starter code with you.
The API states that we can grab character data using this baseURL:
'https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/' with a number at the end.  Let's make our form
submit the character number we want to find and display that character's name in an h1 tag.  Remember that you'll need to use a 'fetch' in order to access the Rick and Morty API.

I have provided started HTML code for you.
